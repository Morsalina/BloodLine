# BloodLine

## Overview
Blood is one of the most essential elements of the human body. It is an emergency to manage blood of the same group to save a life. But sometimes hospitals or clinics cannot supply blood as per requirement, so it becomes very difficult for patientsâ€™ family/friends to manage blood immediately. Considering these emergency situations, we have decided to develop a mobile application which will be able to help find and notify blood donors.
## Motivation
It is a very common scenario that patients need blood to save their lives and hospitals are not able to manage appropriate blood for the patients. So it would be helpful if they can have a source to find blood and know about the donors easily whenever it is needed. Also the donors, who are willing to donate blood will be able to know the emergency situations and places to donate their blood.

To solve this problem we are going to introduce a mobile application which will help people to find donors and track their locations. Also the donors will be able to know where and when to donate blood through this mobile application notification. This app will try to locate the donors who are available in nearby locations.
